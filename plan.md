# Python Agentic Learning Assistant: Development Plan

## Introduction
This application is designed to help users learn about any topic by generating a custom curriculum, guiding them through the learning process with interactive discussions and sourced materials. It leverages backend foundation model APIs and uses agentic programming techniques to maximize user engagement and adaptive learning.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **GUI Framework:** PyQT5 (for advanced features)
- **HTTP Client:** Requests (for API calls)
- **Backend integration:** Foundation model API access for generating curriculum and sourcing material
- **Agentic Programming Constructs:** Modules or functions that can independently manage steps in the learning curriculum
- **Concurrency/Asynchrony:** For handling API requests and agentic tasks effectively (e.g., using asyncio)

## Architecture Overview

### Components
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - A user-friendly interface to input topics and display curriculum steps and discussion interactions.
   - Designed using PyQT5 to provide advanced features and a modern look.

2. **Backend API Integration Module:**
   - Handles communication with the foundation model APIs.
   - Responsible for sending user prompts and receiving curriculum steps and recommended materials.

3. **Agentic Curriculum Generator:**
   - Orchestrates the learning process by dynamically constructing a curriculum based on the user-provided topic.
   - Manages stateful conversation and adapts to user responses.

4. **Discussion & Interaction Module:**
   - Facilitates interactive learning sessions where the user can ask questions and receive tailored responses.
   - Sources additional educational material as needed.

### Data Flow
- **User Input** > GUI 
- GUI sends topic to **Curriculum Generator** via the Backend Integration Module
- **Curriculum Generator** processes the topic with foundation model APIs
- Generated curriculum and resources are sent back to the **GUI** for display
- **Discussion Module** handles follow-up interactions during the learning session

## Development Roadmap

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Create a `requirements.txt` file with necessary dependencies
- Establish a project directory structure

### Step 2: Building the GUI
- Develop the main window for inputting the topic
- Design layout elements such as text areas, buttons, and display panels
- Prototype the GUI using PyQT5 to leverage its advanced features.

### Step 3: Backend Integration
- Implement modules for communicating with foundation model APIs
- Use the `requests` module to handle HTTP communication

### Step 4: Agentic Programming Logic
- Design and implement agentic orchestration functions to guide curriculum generation
- Integrate conversation handling and dynamic curriculum adaptation

### Step 5: Testing and Refinement
- Unit test each module (GUI, backend, agentic logic)
- Conduct integration testing to ensure smooth data flow between components
- Gather user feedback for iterative improvements

### Future Enhancements
- Implement additional GUI improvements or switch to advanced frameworks like Kivy for richer interfaces
- Add real-time collaboration features
- Enable speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities for a more immersive experience
- Refine the agentic logic with more advanced AI model integrations

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the key components and steps required to build a robust, interactive, learning-based application. Each segment—GUI, backend integration, agentic curriculum generation, and interactive discussions—can be built modularly, allowing for iterative enhancements and testing.
